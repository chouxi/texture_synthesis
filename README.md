# texture_synthesis
  This is Assignment2 of CS534 computer vision in Rutgers.

- Part1

  texture synthesis using efros Alg

- Part2

  picture impainting using efros Alg

- Part3

  picture impainting after object removal based on criminis's approach.
  
There are 3 classes,
- base_op
  
  Basic operations of images, such as open images, normalization, init mask, init windowsize.
- efors_algorithm

  Combination of part1 and part2 algorithm.
- criminis_algorithm

  The implementation of part3
